Working with this project was really surprising for me. I have learned so many things, not only about the Design process and TouchDesigner, but about the seismic activity in New Zealand as well.

I see this project as an useful tool for educators, it would be interesting seeing teachers using this application to teach their students about Earthquakes.

The possibilities to improve the project are endless, we could create a better way to interact or make the final result looks better. I also think that the there is not enough information being shown, basic important information such as Magnitude and Depth. It would not be hard to implement these small tweaks and would make the final result more educational.
